Project Proposal

Objective: To design a document analyzing tool capable of 
predicting the essence of the document and to generate a 
logically and semantically correct summary statements


Background

Document summarization is one of the major research fields in Machine Learning and to implicitly summarise a document (abstractive summarisation) or a set of small documents having similar context (like tweets) is a challenging task. It is somewhat similar to Natural Language Processing.


Languages/Platform

Python and its Data Analysing Libraries
Tweepy to use with Twitter API
NLTK for Natural Language Processing


Datasets

http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html
http://www.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html

and any other open dataset that can be found after proper investigation


Algorithms/Techniques

1. Cleaning, stopping and wrangling of documents
2. Training of convolutional neural networks
