					SUDOKU PATTERN RECOGNITION:

A very special thanks to our senior, Ahsan, for suggesting this idea. I preferred choosing this project 
over other ones as it will provide a better insight on the concepts of neural networks and computer vision.

The motto of this project is to predict the soluion of a sudoku with some already placed entries, 
through digit pattern recognition and then applying some backend algorithms to find the result.

The user will scan an image of an incomplete sudoku problem through android device from any printed
or handwritten source. Firstly, through bot/computer vision, the device will recognize the grid structure
and locate the digit position. Next, the digits will be inferred from the given source. This will require 
application of artificial neural networks (using learning  algorithms), recognition of digits in each slot 
if it is there, or interpret it as a blank space if it is not there. 

The idea of neural networks here is to take a large number of handwritten digits, 
known as training examples, and then develop a system which can learn from those training examples. 
In other words, the neural network uses the examples to automatically infer rules for recognizing 
handwritten digits. Furthermore, by increasing the number of training examples, the network can 
learn more about handwriting, and hence improves its accuracy.

This project is highly focused on handwritten digit recognition, since it would be a better approach
problem for learning about neural networks contrary to the printed ones. After the main task, some 
inner algorithms wil be used, similar to backtracking algorithm to fill out the remaining blank spots,
but emphasis will be on making the algo more efficient. The device will then output the correct placement
of each digit in the remaining spots.
